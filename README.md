# Plasma Deposition Modeling Research

## Overview
This repository contains research work on mathematical modeling of plasma parameter scaling and stochastic surface processes in low-pressure sputtering.

## Status: Legacy Script Directory
⚠️ **Note**: This is an older script file directory that contains various research scripts, data files, and preliminary modeling work. 

## Contents
- Cross-section data files (`crosssection/`)
- Monte Carlo simulation results (`montecarlo/`, `voronoi/`)
- Python modeling scripts (`*.py`)
- LaTeX manuscript (`plasma-depo-montecarlo/Plasma-Grain-Deposition/`)
- Result figures (`results/`, `results_test/`)

## Future Work
This directory **needs to be cleaned up and updated** if further scripting and research will happen. Plans include:
- [ ] Reorganize script structure
- [ ] Update deprecated code
- [ ] Consolidate redundant files
- [ ] Add proper documentation
- [ ] Implement modern best practices

## Research Focus
Mathematical framework for:
- Plasma parameter scaling laws
- Stochastic surface processes
- Voronoi tessellation analysis
- Monte Carlo simulations
- Thin film microstructure modeling
